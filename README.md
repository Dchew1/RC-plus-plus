# Project Name

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
**...include the challenge statement(s) the project worked to address**
Travel can be unpredictable. Baggage claim delays and lengthy TSA queues often lead to missed flights, causing frustration and inconvenience for passengers. Let's address this issue head-on and explore how "Catch It" can make a difference.
Examples:
* How might we decrease the United States chances of alien and monster attacks given what we know from popular alien and monster movies?" How might we streamline TSA checkpoint procedures to minimize waiting times and enhance the overall airport experience for passengers?"

* How might we make it possible for people in cities not to have to own a car by making car-sharing easier so that the environment will be less damaged and people can save money? "How might we minimize the impact of unpredictable travel situations, such as baggage claim delays and long TSA queues, to ensure passengers reach their destinations on time, reducing missed flights and enhancing overall travel experiences?
Problem 1
How might we provide travelers with real-time, personalized solutions and alternative routes during travel disruptions, effectively addressing the challenges posed by unforeseen circumstances and significantly improving customer satisfaction and loyalty in the airline industry?"

"How can we enhance communication between airlines, airports, and passengers to ensure timely information about delays and gate changes, reducing the risk of missed flights?"
